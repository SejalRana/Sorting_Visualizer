#Overview

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JS. This project sorting visualizer is a very simple UI 
and it allows the users to select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and speed of the visualization.


#Project Context 

We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort.
But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are
unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these 
algorithms is visualization.

That’s why I am making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work
and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.


#What's inside the project

1. Sorting algorithms - Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quicksort 
2. You can change the size of the array
3. You can change the speed of the visualization


#Approach

• Creating the website's User Interface (UI) using HTML and CSS without actually 
  implementing any of the app's core features.
• Implementation of animations, effects and core functionalities (sorting algorithms) 
  using JavaScript.
